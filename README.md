EDA for Data Science Job Market in the US for August 2018:

Outline:
Choose 3 to 4 cities from dataset to focus on and compare how data scientist jobs are available and what is the trend and conclusions we can draw from those comparisons.

Resources for dataset:
1. Pew Research Center
2. Kaggle
3. (Search for most up-to-date datasets?)

Questions:
1. Who gets hired? What kind of talent do employers want when they're hiring a data scientist?
2. Which locations has the most opportunities?
3. What skills, tools, degrees, or majors do employers want the most for data scientists?
4. What's the difference between data scientist, data engineer and data analyst?


Possible trend:
1. There is a shortage of 151,717 people with data science skills, with particularly acute shortages in New York City, San Francisco, and LA. (Use those three cities for our focus?)
